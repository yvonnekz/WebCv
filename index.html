                <p>The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, 
                    and it didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging
                     from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome 
                     the other odors emitting from the cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell
                      out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and didn't have a choice.
